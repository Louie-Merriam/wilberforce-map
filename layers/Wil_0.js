The neighborhood was created by Reverend Stephen Bloomer Balch, who named the neighborhood after the abolitionist William Wilberforce. While Balch supported the American Colonization Society and the Back-To-Africa movement, the name choice reflects the diverse nature of the neighborhood. Though largely forgotten today, the story of Wilberforce is a powerful testament to the history of diverse communities in Washington DC."},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-77.068419572418648,38.916592006420053],[-77.067297875965153,38.916716684676807],[-77.069426810050373,38.919619845004291],[-77.070594290032574,38.91937049847315],[-77.068419572418648,38.916592006420053]]]}}]}
